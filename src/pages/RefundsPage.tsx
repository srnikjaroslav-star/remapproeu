            <p>
              Under EU law (Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights), the right of withdrawal is 
              lost at the moment the performance has begun with the consumer's prior express consent 
              and acknowledgment that they thereby lose their right of withdrawal.

            <p className="mt-4">
              By clicking <strong>"Proceed to Payment"</strong> and completing your order, you 
              expressly consent to the immediate performance of the service and acknowledge that 
              you lose your right to a 14-day withdrawal period once the tuning file has been 
              processed and made available for download.

            <p>
              Each tuning file is custom-created for your specific vehicle based on the ECU file 
              you provide. Once our engineers have processed your file and created your custom 
              tune, the service has been fully rendered. Unlike physical goods, digital tuning 
              files cannot be "returned" as they have already been created and delivered.

            <p>
              While refunds are not available, we are committed to customer satisfaction. We may 
              provide remedies in the following situations:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Technical Issues</strong> — If our file does not function correctly due to our error, we will provide a corrected file at no additional cost</li>
              <li><strong>Unprocessable Files</strong> — If we are unable to process your ECU file for technical reasons, we will issue a full refund</li>
              <li><strong>Service Cancellation</strong> — If you cancel before we begin processing your file, a refund may be issued minus any processing fees</li>
